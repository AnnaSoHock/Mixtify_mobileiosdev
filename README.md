# Mixtify - IOS Mobile App Dev

This App was a project submission for Cal Poly Pomona's sheCodes club. We participated in the Semester Long Project program.
This App currently showcases a static layout of a music app, with the intention of integrating Spotify's API. The code can be accessed under the branch labeled as "annaEntireProjectFile".

# Spotify Web API Integration 

We are currently working on integrating Spotify's Web API, but ran into a few issues since our Static layout is in a SwiftUI layout and the API seems to be only
compatible with GridView layouts in XCode. This project is still in progress. Here is a demo of how the API can be implemented and user authenticated if the code is written inside a GridView structure.
